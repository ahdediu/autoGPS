_Last updated: 2025-07-04_

**AutoGPS** (“the App”) is published by **Departamento de Engenharias e de Ciências da Computação** de **Universidade Autónoma de Lisboa**.  


## 1. Data we collect
| Category | Examples | Purpose | Stored? |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| Location | GPS latitude/longitude | Show user position on campus map | No |
| Bluetooth | Beacon UUID & RSSI | Indoor positioning | No |
| Audio | Live microphone audio | Voice commands (speech-to-text) | No |

We do **not** collect name, e-mail, phone number or advertising identifiers.

## 2. How we use data
Data is processed **locally on your device** solely to provide navigation and
hands-free control. Nothing is transmitted to our servers or any third party.

## 3. Sharing with third parties
We do **not** share, sell or rent any personal data. The App uses only
open-source Flutter libraries that work entirely on-device.

## 4. Permissions
* **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** – required to obtain GPS coordinates.  
* **BLUETOOTH_SCAN / BLUETOOTH_CONNECT** – required to detect beacon signals.  
* **RECORD_AUDIO** – required for voice commands.  
Denying a permission disables its related feature but the App continues running.

## 5. Security & retention
No personal data leaves the device; therefore no network transmission occurs.
Any cached sensor readings are erased whenever you close the App.

## 6. Children
AutoGPS is intended for university students and not directed at children under 13.

## 7. Changes
We may update this policy. Changes will appear on this page with a new date.
